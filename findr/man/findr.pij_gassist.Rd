\title{
Predict pairwise regulation probability with expression and eQTL data
}
\description{
Inference of regulation E(A)->A->B probability with expression data of A,B and best eQTL data for A as E(A). For highest precision, the user should not pre-select secondary target genes (B), but instead include as many B's of the same type as possible, and pick the gene pairs of interest only after Findr's calculation. This function does not include p1.


findr.pij\_gassist performs the novel combination of causal inference tests.

findr.pij\_gassist\_trad performs traditional combination of causal inference tests, but is not and is not intended as a reimplementation of Trigger package.
}
\usage{
findr.pij_gassist(dg, dt, dt2, na = NULL, nodiag = FALSE)
findr.pij_gassist_trad(dg, dt, dt2, na = NULL, nodiag = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dg}{
Input matrix of best eQTL genotype data E(A), each row of which is the best eQTL of the corresponding row of dt. Data is in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the genotype value of the best eQTL of gene i of sample j, and should be among values 0,1,...,na. The matrix has dimension (nt,ns).
}
  \item{dt}{
Input matrix of expression levels of A in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the expression level of gene i of sample j. The matrix has dimension (nt,ns).
}
  \item{dt2}{
Input matrix of expression levels of B in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the expression level of gene i of sample j. The matrix has dimension (nt2,ns)
}
  \item{na}{
Number of alleles for the species considered. This constrains every genotype data to be among 0,1,...,na. If unspecified (NULL), na is automatically determined as the maximum value of dg.
}
  \item{nodiag}{
When A and B are the same, log likelihood ratio between alternative and null hypotheses gives infinity. To avoid its contamination in the conversion from log likelihood ratios into probabilities, users need to arrange data accordingly, when {A} and {B} are the same or when {A} is a subset of {B}. The top submatrix of B's expression data must be identical with A, and nodiag must be set to TRUE. Otherwise, in the default configuration, {A} and {B} should not have any intersection and nodiag = FALSE.
}
}
\value{
Output matrix of recommended combination of multiple test results. Element [i,j] is the test probability of A->B for A = gene i and B = gene j. The matrix has dimension (nt,nt2).
}
\note{
The methodology is to first calculate the log likelihood ratio (LLR) for each test, and then convert the LLRs into probabilities, for each A against all Bs.

nt: Number of genes for A.

nt2: Number of genes for B.

ns: Number of samples.
