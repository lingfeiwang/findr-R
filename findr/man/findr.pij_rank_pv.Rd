\title{
Predict pairwise regulation p-value with expression data
}
\description{
Inference of pairwise correlation A- - -B p-value between gene sets {A} and {B}, with expression data only.
}
\usage{
findr.pij_rank_pv(dt, dt2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dt}{
Input matrix of expression levels of A in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the expression level of gene i of sample j. The matrix has dimension (nt,ns).
}
  \item{dt2}{
Input matrix of expression levels of B in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the expression level of gene i of sample j. The matrix has dimension (nt2,ns).
}
}
\value{
Output matrix of inferred probability of correlation A- - -B versus no correlation A    B in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the p-value of gene i being correlated with gene j. The matrix has dimension (nt,nt2).
}
\note{
After normalization, the function first calculates the log likelihood ratio or equivalently Pearson correlation between each pair of A and B, and then converts them into p-values.

nt: Number of genes for A.

nt2: Number of genes for B.

ns: Number of samples.
