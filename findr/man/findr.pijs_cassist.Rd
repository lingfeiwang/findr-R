\title{
Predict pairwise regulation probability with expression data and continuous causal anchors
}
\description{
Inference of regulation E(A)->A->B probability with expression data of A,B and continuous anchor data for A as E(A). This is similar with using eQTL but treats E(A) as a continuous variable. For highest precision, the user should not pre-select secondary target genes (B), but instead include as many B's of the same type as possible, and pick the gene pairs of interest only after Findr's calculation.
}
\usage{
findr.pijs_cassist(dc, dt, dt2, nodiag = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dc}{
Input matrix of continuous anchor data E(A), each row of which is the anchor of the corresponding row of dt. Data is in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the value of the continuous anchor of gene i of sample j. The matrix has dimension (nt,ns).
}
  \item{dt}{
Input matrix of expression levels of A in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the expression level of gene i of sample j. The matrix has dimension (nt,ns).
}
  \item{dt2}{
Input matrix of expression levels of B in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the expression level of gene i of sample j. The matrix has dimension (nt2,ns)
}
  \item{nodiag}{
When A and B are the same, log likelihood ratio between alternative and null hypotheses gives infinity. To avoid its contamination in the conversion from log likelihood ratios into probabilities, users need to arrange data accordingly, when {A} and {B} are the same or when {A} is a subset of {B}. The top submatrix of B's expression data must be identical with A, and nodiag must be set to TRUE. Otherwise, in the default configuration, {A} and {B} should not have any intersection and nodiag = FALSE.
}
}
\value{
\item{p1}{Output vector of inferred probability of test 1, E(A)->A (alternative) versus E(A) A (null), in array format. Element [i] is the probability of best eQTL of gene i regulates gene i. The vector has dimension (nt). For nodiag=F, because the function expects significant eQTLs, p1 always return 1. For nodiag=T, uses diagonal elements of p2. Consider replacing p1 with your own (1-FPR) from eQTL discovery.}
\item{p2}{Output matrix of inferred probability of test 2, E(A)->A- - -B with E(A)->B (alternative) versus E(A)->A<-B (null), in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the probability of alternative hypothesis for A = gene i and B = gene j. The matrix has dimension (nt,nt2).}
\item{p3}{Output matrix of inferred probability of test 3, E(A)->A->B (null) versus E(A)->A- - -B with E(A)->B (alternative), in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the probability of null hypothesis for A = gene i and B = gene j. The matrix has dimension (nt,nt2).}
\item{p4}{Output matrix of inferred probability of test 4, E(A)->A- - -B with E(A)->B (alternative) versus E(A)->A B, in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the probability of alternative hypothesis for A = gene i and B = gene j. The matrix has dimension (nt,nt2).}
\item{p5}{Output matrix of inferred probability of test 5, E(A)->A- - -B with E(A)->B (alternative) versus B<-E(A)->A, in matrix format. Element [i,j] is the probability of alternative hypothesis for A = gene i and B = gene j. The matrix has dimension (nt,nt2).}
}
\note{
The methodology is to first calculate the log likelihood ratio (LLR) for each test, and then convert the LLRs into probabilities, for each A against all Bs.

nt: Number of genes for A.

nt2: Number of genes for B.

ns: Number of samples.
