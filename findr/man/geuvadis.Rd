\title{Part of expression and best eQTL data from GEUVADIS}
\format{A list with the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item dgmi: haplotypes of the best cis-eQTLs of 10 miRNAs
  \item dmi: expression levels of 10 miRNAs
  \item dgt: haplotypes of the best cis-eQTLs of 1000 genes
  \item dt: expression levels of 1000 genes that have cis-eQTLs
  \item dt2: expression levels of all 3000 genes
  \item dc: continuous causal anchors for demonstration purposes, simulated from adding continuous noise to dgmi

\description{The dataset is downsampled from the Geuvadis study, including expression levels of 10 miRNAs and 3000 genes for 360 European individuals. Among them, all miRNAs and 1000 genes have significant cis-eQTLs, whose haplotypes are also included.
